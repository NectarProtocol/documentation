## Introduction



  
In 2014, the [Living Heart Project](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/solutions/life-sciences-healthcare/the-living-heart-project/) kicked off, debuting the first simulated real-life heart. Powered by the 3DExperience platform from Dassault Systèmes, the research has brought together leading physicians, researchers, educators, medical device developers, regulatory agencies, and practicing cardiologists from across the world to develop personalized digital heart models. The project just received additional federal funding, expanding the scope to virtual patients and computational modeling.

  

In 2017, an article in The Journal of Arthroplasty found that [personalized knee replacement](https://www.arthroplastytoday.org/article/S2352-3441(17)30040-7/fulltext) devices had far better outcomes at no additional cost than “out of the box” knee replacement devices.

  

In 2018, a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6202760/) was published in Acta Orthopaedica about a December 2017 shoulder replacement surgery on an 80-year old woman with advanced arthritis. This surgery was guided by Microsoft’s HoloLens, which personalized guided steps for the surgery based on the patient’s medical history and operating technique which were accessible and visible in real time via the HoloLens: “the surgeon was able to compare, stage by stage, what he was doing with what had to be done” for the surgery.

  

In 2019, a surgeon in China successfully completed a liver removal of a lab animal over a 5G internet connection. The surgeon was at a different location [30 miles away](https://in.pcmag.com/news/128092/china-performs-first-5g-remote-surgery).

  

In 2020, because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, clinicians in the United States were allowed to practice telemedicine [across state borders](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/telehealth/index.html) without concern to their State Licensure. In 2021, the Center for Care Innovations presented a host of evidence that, for many clinical applications, telemedicine was [*just as, if not more effective*,](https://www.careinnovations.org/virtualcare/resources/evidence-for-telemedicine-efficacy-and-quality/) than in-person care.

  

In 2021, the opportunity of *in silico* trials (trials performed by computer simulation) promises [better, faster, and cheaper clinical trials](https://trialsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13063-020-05002-w).

  

The future of healthcare is exciting. The future of healthcare is Web3.

  

The future of healthcare is not bound by geographical boundaries; it blurs the line between reality and digital; it is more effective and less expensive; it is data rich.

  

But, healthcare has strict data and security protocols and regulations - specifically for personally identifiable data.

  

The key to Web3 for healthcare is *personalized medicine* which is made possible by *personalized, identifiable data*.

  

But, “ethical issues related to fair and responsible data usage, as well as privacy, ownership, security, and authentication are paramount.”

  

Cutting edge, Web3 innovation cannot ignore data and security protocols and regulations, no matter how outdated the regulations are.

  

Additionally, innovation occurs at the enterprise level.

  

-   The Living Heart Project was initiated by Dassault Systèmes, a company founded in 1981 with €4.5B annual revenues;
    
-   The personalized knee replacements were conducted at a teaching hospital;
    
-   The HoloLens shoulder replacement was conducted at a 1,097 bed hospital in France (to compare, Massachusetts General, one of the leading hospitals in the United States, has 1,059 beds - these are large teaching institutions)
    
-   The remote surgery in China was conducted by a surgeon from Beijing's 301 Hospital which has 4,000 beds
    
-   While telehealth was started by startups, the leading telehealth company is now valued north of $15B (and they've been HIPAA compliant since they began)
    
-   And, *in silico* trials are led by researchers which are either in teaching and university institutions or, if a startup, came from teaching and university institutions
    

Enterprises do not skimp on data and security practices.

  

We’ve also learned, from Web1 through Web2, that public networks (Internet vs. Intranet) and [open source software](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7160503) are leading factors in innovation.

  

The future of healthcare requires a foundation that fosters innovation in an open, accessible, data rich, regulatory compliant way, while remaining flexible enough to accommodate data and security policies that inevitably modernize.


The future of healthcare is built on Nectar.
